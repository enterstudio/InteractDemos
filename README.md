# InteractDemos

A collection of demos using the Julia Interact package, it will be turned into a Julia server powered website at some point

## Set up locally

Before I set up this on some server, you can try it locally. Clone the repository, install Interact and Mux packages in Julia and then run:

`include("main.jl")`

from within the InteractDemos directory.
